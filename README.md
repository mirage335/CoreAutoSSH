# Version
v1.0

Semantic versioning is applied. Major version numbers (v2.x) indicate a compatible API. Minor numbers indicate the current feature set has been tested for usability. Any git commits not tagged with a version number may be technically considered unstable development code. New functions present in git commits may be experimental.

In most user environments, the latest git repository code will provide the strongest reliability guarantees. Extra safety checks are occasionally added as possible edge cases are discovered.
